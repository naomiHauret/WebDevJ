# WebDevJ
A personal project I'm developping since this summer. This software, designed in Java is a WYSIWYG IDE based on web playgrounds like JSBin, JSFiddle, Codepen... A panel for your HTML, another for you CSS, another for your Javascript and a last one so you can see the result in an embed browser (JxBrowser). The 3 coding panels can are tabbed panes, so you can edit several files at once.
